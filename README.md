# TravelWise
AI-Powered Location Intelligence Platform

TravelWise is an AI-powered travel planning platform that intelligently generates personalized, budget-aware, time-optimized travel plans using geospatial data and a multi-agent AI architecture.

Unlike traditional travel apps, TravelWise treats travel planning as a real-world decision-making and optimization problem, considering constraints such as:

1.Budget limits

2.Time availability

3.Transportation options

4.Location distance & traffic

5.Place availability

6.Risk and fallback planning

The system uses specialized AI agents coordinated by a planner agent, making it robust, and scalable.
